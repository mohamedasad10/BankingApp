# BankingApp
Overview

BankingApp is a simple yet functional command-line banking system built in Java. It allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, transfer money between accounts, and view transaction histories. This project was developed to demonstrate object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Features

Deposit & Withdrawal: Perform transactions securely with balance validation.

Funds Transfer: Transfer money between different accounts with validation checks.

Transaction History: View detailed transaction logs including type, amount, and status.

Error Handling: Proper validation to prevent invalid transactions.

Technologies Used

Java: Core language for development.

OOP Principles: Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

Collections Framework: Utilized ArrayList for account and transaction management.
